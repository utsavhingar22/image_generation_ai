# Image Generation for E-commerce

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a generative AI model that produces high-quality product images for e-commerce platforms. The aim is to enhance product listings with diverse and high-resolution images and provide virtual try-on experiences to improve customer engagement and sales.

## Use Cases
### Product Image Augmentation
**Problem Statement:** E-commerce platforms often lack diverse and high-quality images for their product listings, impacting sales and customer trust.

**Solution:** Utilize a generative adversarial network (GAN) to augment existing product images, generating multiple high-resolution images from different angles and in various settings to enhance product listings.

### Virtual Try-On Experiences
**Problem Statement:** Customers are hesitant to purchase apparel and accessories online due to uncertainty about fit and appearance.

**Solution:** Implement a virtual try-on feature using generative AI that allows customers to visualize products on themselves in real-time, increasing conversion rates and reducing return rates.

## Implementation
### Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- CUDA (for GPU acceleration)

### Data Preparation
Prepare your dataset by organizing images in a directory structure compatible with `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder`. Apply necessary image transformations such as resizing, cropping, and normalization.

### Model Architecture
The project uses a GAN architecture with a Generator and Discriminator network. The Generator creates new images from random noise, while the Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated images.

### Training
The GAN is trained using a combination of real and generated images, updating both networks' weights to improve the Generator's ability to create realistic images.

### Example Code
The code provided in this repository includes:
- Data loading and transformation
- Generator and Discriminator network definitions
- Training loop for the GAN

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
3. Update the `data_dir` and `output_dir` paths in the notebook.
4. Run the notebook to train the GAN and generate augmented images.
